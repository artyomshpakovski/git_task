Late night telephone
Calling all the wallflowers I know
Out the dark and into the light
Half love, half regret
Dressing up for polaroids and cigarettes
Socialize, romanticize the life

Floating on my low key vibe
Floating on my low key vibe, vibe, vibe
I don't need that late night high
I'm floating on my vibe
Vibe, vibe, vibe, vibe, vibe
